#Triangle Problem:

I was given the following problem to solve using javascript. In order to
accomplish this task, I used Node and Jasmine to run tests and parse the file
that was given to me.

> Start at the top node (9) of the below triangle and move down via adjacent nodes of the below rows. Find the largest sum of nodes along any of those traversal paths. The largest sum for the given triangle is 21.
> 
>        9
> 
>      2   1
> 
>     1  5  7
> 
>   9  5  3  3
> 
> Path being: 9 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 21.
> 
> Find the same solution for the triangle in generated_triangle.txt
> 
> The correct answer is 14584.
> 
> make sure to cover this problem with unit tests and have it production quality.

In order to run the following code, run the command:

`npm install; npm test;

I also noticed that the correct answer that was given to me was lower than what
I was expecting.
